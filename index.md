![My Picture](/assets/img/circle-cropped.png) 

Hello, world! My name is Grace, and I currently am a Master's student at William and Mary for Business Analytics. In addition to being a full time student, I also work at a nonprofit (LCLD) where I supports all of the organization's membership and operations initiatives. This page will primarily focus on projects I have worked on at school as well as work to showcase the skills I have learned through the MSBA program. If you have any questions, you can reach out to me at gymitchell@email.wm.edu.

Launched in the fall of 2020, the Leaders at the Front is a peer-driven initiative designed to make diversity, equity, and inclusion sustainable within our organizations and our profession. It asks the Members of LCLD, the leaders of the legal profession, to expand their commitments to inclusion by personally creating leadership paths for diverse attorneys and driving sustainable cultural changes within their organizations.
