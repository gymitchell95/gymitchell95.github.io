THE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL ON LEGAL DIVERSITY is an organization of more than 350 corporate chief legal officers and law firm managing partners—the leadership of the profession—who have dedicated themselves to creating a truly diverse U.S. legal profession. Our action programs are designed to attract, inspire, and nurture the talent in society and within our organizations, thereby helping a new and more diverse generation of attorneys ascend to positions of leadership.

Leaders at the Front is a peer-driven initiative designed to make diversity, equity, and inclusion sustainable within our organizations and our profession. It asks the Members of LCLD, the leaders of the legal profession, to expand their commitments to inclusion by personally creating leadership paths for diverse attorneys and driving sustainable cultural changes within their organizations.
