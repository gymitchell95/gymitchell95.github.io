description: Hello, world! My name is Grace, and I currently am a Master's student at William and Mary for Business Analytics. In addition to being a full time student, I also work at a nonprofit (LCLD) where I supports all of the organization's membership and operations initiatives.
This page will primarily focus on projects I have worked on at school as well as work to showcase the skills I have learned through the program. If you have any questions, you can raech out to me at gymitchell@email.wm.edu.
